### 2. **Expose via ngrok (optional)**
- Set your NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN in a `.env` file or environment variable.
- The API will be accessible via a public ngrok URL.

### 3. **API Endpoints**

- `POST /RE/extract`  
  Extract relations from input text and NER entities.
  ```json

    "text": "Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft Corporation. He was born in Hyderabad and graduated from the University of Wisconsin. Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates.",
    "entities": {
      "PERSON": ["Satya Nadella", "Bill Gates"],

      "LOC": ["Hyderabad"]
    }
  }
  ```
  **Response:**
  ```json
  {

      {"subject": "Satya Nadella", "relation": "per:works", "object": "Microsoft Corporation"},
      {"subject": "Satya Nadella", "relation": "per:born_in", "object": "Hyderabad"},
      {"subject": "Satya Nadella", "relation": "per:education", "object": "University of Wisconsin"},
      {"subject": "Microsoft", "relation": "org:founded_by", "object": "Bill Gates"}
    ],
    "processing_time": 1.23
  }
  ```

- `GET /RE/health`  
  Health check endpoint.

- `GET /RE/info`  
  Model and schema information.

## üß™ Evaluation & Batch Processing
- Use the provided `run_pipeline()` in `RE.py` for batch extraction from uploaded files (Colab or local).
- Results are saved as JSON and can be pretty-printed using the `display_relations` method.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
- **Model selection**: Change the model name in `RE.py` if needed.
- **Relation/entity types**: Extend the `initialize_schema` method in `RE.py`.
- **ngrok**: Set your token in `.env` for public API exposure.
