      "reference_summary": "A new study published in Nature Communications suggests the prolonged global warming following the Permian extinction ('Great Dying') was driven by the collapse of tropical forests. Analyzing fossil data, researchers found deforestation significantly reduced Earth's carbon storage capacity, maintaining high atmospheric CO2 levels for millions of years, even after volcanic activity subsided.  This highlights a potential \"threshold effect,\" where forest loss becomes irreversible, impeding carbon cycles and hindering recovery.  The findings serve as a warning for the future, suggesting that rainforest collapse from human-caused warming could trigger a similar, self-perpetuating cycle of extreme climate change.",
      "generated_summary": "Scientists have discovered why the planet remained hot for 5 million years after the 'Great Dying' The loss of tropical forests significantly reduced the planet's ability to store carbon. This led to high levels of carbon lingering in the atmosphere for millions of years. If rapid global warming causes today\u2019s rainforests to collapse, the planet could reach a tipping point where warming accelerates, even if human carbon emissions were to stop. The study makes it clear that pushing tropical forests too far could have catastrophic consequences.",
