    "Long-1":"Around 252 million years ago, life on Earth suffered its most catastrophic blow to date: a mass extinction event known as the 'Great Dying' that wiped out around 90% of life. What followed has long puzzled scientists. The planet became lethally hot and remained so for 5 million years. A team of international researchers say they have now figured out why using a vast trove of fossils — and it all revolves around tropical forests. Their findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, may help solve a mystery, but they also spell out a dire warning for the future as humans continue to heat up the planet by burning fossil fuels.The Great Dying was the worst of the five mass extinction events that have punctuated Earth’s history, and it marked the end of the Permian geological period. It has been attributed to a period of volcanic activity in a region known as the Siberian Traps, which released huge amounts of carbon and other planet-heating gases into the atmosphere, causing intense global warming. Enormous numbers of marine and land-based plants and animals died, ecosystems collapsed and oceans acidified. What has been less clear, however, is why it got so hot and why “super greenhouse” conditions persisted for so long, even after volcanic activity ceased. 'The level of warming is far beyond any other event,' said Zhen Xu, a study author and a research fellow at the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. Some theories revolve around the ocean and the idea that extreme heat wiped out carbon-absorbing plankton, or changed the ocean’s chemical composition to make it less effective at storing carbon. But scientists from the University of Leeds in England and the China University of Geosciences thought the answer may lie in a climate tipping point: the collapse of tropical forests. The Great Dying extinction event is unique 'because it’s the only one in which the plants all die off,' said Benjamin Mills, a study author and a professor of Earth system evolution at the University of Leeds. To test the theory, they used an archive of fossil data in China that has been put together over decades by three generations of Chinese geologists.They analyzed the fossils and rock formations to get clues about climate conditions in the past, allowing them to reconstruct maps of plants and trees living on each part of the planet before, during and after the extinction event. 'Nobody’s ever made maps like these before,' Mills told CNN. The results confirmed their hypothesis, showing that the loss of vegetation during the mass extinction event significantly reduced the planet’s ability to store carbon, meaning very high levels remained in the atmosphere. Forests are a vital climate buffer as they suck up and store planet-heating carbon. They also play a crucial role in 'silicate weathering,' a chemical process involving rocks and rainwater — a key way of removing carbon from the atmosphere. Tree and plant roots help this process by breaking up rock and allowing fresh water and air to reach it. Once the forests die, 'you’re changing the carbon cycle,' Mills said, referring to the way carbon moves around the Earth, between the atmosphere, land, oceans and living organisms. Michael Benton, a professor of paleontology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, said the research shows 'the absence of forests really impacts the regular oxygen-carbon cycles and suppresses carbon burial and so high levels of CO2 remain in the atmosphere over prolonged periods,' he told CNN. It highlights 'a threshold effect,' he added, where the loss of forests becomes 'irreversible on ecological time scales.” Global politics currently revolve around the idea that if carbon dioxide levels can be controlled, damage can be reversed. 'But at the threshold, it then becomes hard for life to recover,' Benton said. This is a key takeaway from the study, Mills said. It shows what might happen if rapid global warming causes the planet’s rainforests to collapse in the future — a tipping point scientists are very concerned about. Even if humans stop pumping out planet-heating pollution altogether, the Earth may not cool. In fact, warming could accelerate, he said. There is a sliver of hope: The rainforests that currently carpet the tropics may be more resilient to high temperatures than those that existed before the Great Dying. This is the question the scientists are tackling next. This study is still a warning, Mills said. 'There is a tipping point there. If you warm tropical forests too much, then we have a very good record of what happens. And it’s extremely bad.'", 
    "Long-2":"A cyber hacker broke into a database containing the personal information of millions of customers, Qantas (QAN.AX), opens new tab said, in Australia's biggest breach in years and a setback for an airline rebuilding trust after a reputational crisis. The hacker targeted a call centre and gained access to a third-party customer service platform containing six million names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers, Qantas said in a statement on Wednesday. The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here. The airline did not specify the location of the call centre or customers whose information was compromised. It said it learnt of the breach after detecting unusual activity on the platform and acted immediately to contain it. 'We are continuing to investigate the proportion of the data that has been stolen, though we expect it will be significant,' Qantas said, reporting no impact on operations or safety. Last week, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said cybercrime group Scattered Spider was targeting airlines and that Hawaiian Airlines (HAII.UL) and Canada's WestJet had already reported breaches. Qantas did not name any group. 'What makes this trend particularly alarming is its scale and coordination, with fresh reports that Qantas is the latest victim' of a hack, said Mark Thomas, Australia director of security services for cyber security firm Arctic Wolf. Scattered Spider hackers are known to impersonate a company's tech staff to gain employee passwords and 'it is plausible they are executing a similar playbook', Thomas said. Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer of Alphabet-owned (GOOGL.O), opens new tab cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said it was too soon to say if Scattered Spider was responsible but 'global airline organisations should be on high alert of social engineering attacks'. Qantas' share price was down 2.4% in afternoon trading against an overall market that was up 0.8%. UNWELCOME ATTENTION The breach is Australia's most high-profile since those of telecommunications network operator Optus and health insurance leader Medibank (MPL.AX), opens new tab in 2022 prompted cyber resilience laws including mandatory reporting of compliance and incidents. It brings unwelcome attention to Qantas which is trying to win public trust after actions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic saw it plunge on airline and brand league tables. Qantas was found to have illegally sacked thousands of ground workers during the 2020 border closure while collecting government stimulus payments. It also admitted selling thousands of tickets for already-cancelled flights. The airline drew the ire of opposition politicians who said it lobbied the federal government in 2022 to refuse a request from Qatar Airways to sell more flights. Qantas denied pressuring the government which eventually refused the request - a move the consumer regulator said hurt price competition. Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson has improved the airline's public standing since taking office in 2023, reputation measures showed. 'We recognise the uncertainty this will cause,' Hudson said of the data breach. 'Our customers trust us with their personal information and we take that responsibility seriously.' Qantas said it notified the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Australian Federal Police. ACSC declined to comment and AFP said only that it was aware of the incident. The OAIC was not immediately available for comment. The airline said the hacker did not access frequent flyer accounts or customer passwords, PIN numbers or log in details.",
    "Medium-1": "The company behind Cursor , the viral AI coding editor, launched a web app on Monday that allows users to manage a network of coding agents directly from their browser. The launch marks Cursor's next big step beyond its integrated development environment (IDE), the core product developers use to access its tools. While Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, initially offered only this AI-powered IDE, the company has made a concerted effort to put its products in more places and develop more agent-powered experiences for users. In May, Cursor launched background agents — AI systems that solve coding tasks autonomously without user supervision. In June, the company launched a Slack integration that allows users to assign tasks to these background agents by tagging @Cursor, similar to how Cognitions's AI coding agent, Devin, operates. Now, with the web app, Cursor users can send natural language requests via browser — on desktop or mobile— to assign background agents tasks such as writing features or fixing bugs in their codebase. The web app also lets users monitor agents working on other tasks, view their progress, and merge completed changes into the codebase. Andrew Milich, Cursor's head of product engineering, tells TechCrunch that the Slack integration and web app are part of an effort to 'remove the friction' for users who rely on Cursor — and it seems many do. Anysphere announced last month that Cursor has crossed $500 million in annualized recurring revenue, largely driven by monthly subscriptions. The company also said Cursor is now used by more than half of the Fortune 500, including companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe. To capitalize on this growth, Anysphere recently launched a $200-per-month Pro tier for Cursor.",
    "Medium-2": "The path to superintelligence is unclear. But Meta is chasing it anyway. The tech giant has jumped headfirst into building a superintelligence lab, seeking to create an AI system that can far outperform human intelligence in all domains. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has attempted to court hundreds of talented engineers and researchers for the lab with eye-popping pay packages, according to The Wall Street Journal. With Meta facing powerful competition in the red hot AI industry, the company's commitment to superintelligence may be a bid to play catch-up and a 'case of one-upmanship,' said Bob Rogers, chief product and technology officer of Oii.ai and co-founder of BeeKeeper AI. 'They probably have a fear that someone's going to end up with the ultimate model that wipes out everybody else, and they'll end up being beholden to one organization,' he said. But without a precise vision, chasing superintelligence may be a pipe dream, he said. 'Going after a vague, undefined goal is not usually the path to success,' said Rogers. 'To immediately jump from where we are now – which is (large language models) being really cool language factories – and skipping (artificial general intelligence) to go straight to superintelligence is bold.' Superintelligence, not 'Superwisdom' As it stands, superintelligence is only theoretical. There are a number of hurdles in the way of creating an all-knowing AI model: As it stands, researchers haven't figured out how to make AI stop hallucinating, especially as we continue to challenge models with reasoning. The harder the task, the more likely it is to make a mistake, said Rogers. For an AI model to be considered superintelligent, 'It's got to be really good at not hallucinating,' he said. In addition to the technical obstacles, creating a system that's that intelligent is incredibly risky, said Rogers, and could be riskier depending on who is in charge of it. The larger models get, the more unpredictable they become, he said. Plus, even if developers create kill switches, the models may be powerful enough to work around them. Beyond the barriers and risks, the pot of gold at the end of the superintelligence rainbow may not be worth it, said Rogers. Enterprises are currently struggling to manage the large language models of today, and often find success with implementing small, niche models and agents, something which Meta's Llama family of models happen to be well-suited for, he noted.",
    "Medium-3": "As the world's largest standalone cybersecurity company, Palo Alto Networks has potentially much to gain from a splintering world. Not to mention, its stock offers a relatively unfiltered view of investor confidence in the sector. But while the company has risen nearly 9% so far this year, and some analysts are gung ho, a look under the hood suggests that astronomical growth can't carry on forever, even if geopolitics feels like a dice roll in a game of Risk at the moment. The Maturity Equation: Back in January, almost 60% of organizations including private companies told the World Economic Forum that geopolitical tensions have impacted their cybersecurity strategies. Many are also on edge about risks: One in three CEOs said they were worried about losing sensitive information or intellectual property to cyber-espionage, and 45% of cyber leaders expressed concern about operational and business disruptions. The rise of state-sanctioned cyberattacks, with China and Russia the best-known sponsors, and recent warnings to US companies to prep for potential cyberattacks from Iran have inflamed tensions. All that suggests a market for Palo Alto Networks to grow into, what with its next-generation firewalls, cloud security services and AI-powered security operations. Goldman Sachs analysts are among those who see this logic: They maintained a buy rating on the company earlier this month, citing its revenue growth of roughly 14% in the past 12 months and its success in selling new products to existing customers. But, on the other hand, there's a maturity challenge: Palo Alto Networks sales growth has slowed — its revenue growth was in the mid-20s percentage points in 2023, and its latest quarter saw revenues grow 15.7% year over year. Meanwhile, the growth of annual recurring revenue — which offers a glimpse into the company's ability to retain customers — has declined in five straight quarters, and it's expected to be around 32% this year, compared with 45% or more in previous years. Even as Palo Alto beat revenue and earnings expectations in its latest quarter, the slowdown suggests the company may be maturing and reaching a plateau where customer adoption is slowing —a reality that cybersecurity firms will have to learn to live with, as other industries have. Nevertheless, the sector is expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade, meaning there will be plenty of dollars to compete for, but likely more competitors. Palo Alto, at the very least, proved more resilient during a week of concerns about conflict with Iran than the broader tech industry. Its shares rose 0.8% last week, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF fell 1.8% over the same period. Hitting the Firewall: Nikesh Arora, the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, makes a living putting up firewalls, but he also knows the feeling of rejection. He told the Humans of Bombay podcast earlier this month that after graduating from university, he was rejected from more than 400 jobs. 'I saved all the rejection letters,' he said. 'They're my motivation.'",
    "Short-1": "Researchers compared raw AI models with their chat-trained versions to understand what safety training actually changes inside the model—like finding the 'off-limits' neurons that make a model refuse harmful requests. They discovered that Anthropic's standard comparison technique was hallucinating thousands of fake differences, but their BatchTopK fix revealed real interpretable safety circuits like refusal detection and stereotype filtering, capturing 88% of behavioral changes versus just 60% for the broken method.",
    "Short-2": "Oracle has quietly become a key player in the AI compute race, largely due to the success of its partnership with ByteDance. The two companies poured billions into data centers in Singapore and Malaysia, which is now the world's second-largest AI hub. The company was the single largest lessor of datacenter capacity in the US from late 2023 to early 2025, securing over $130 billion in contracts expected over the next 12 months, including Stargate deals.",
    "reference": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A Qatari regulator said on Sunday it had fined First Abu Dhabi Bank 200 million Qatari riyals ($55 million) for obstructing an ongoing investigation into suspected market manipulation, a charge the bank later denied. Qatar last year alleged that First Abu Dhabi Bank, the United Arab Emirates' largest lender, made 'bogus' foreign exchange deals to harm Qatar's economy after the UAE and other Arab states began a boycott of Qatar in 2017. The Regulatory Authority of Qatar Financial Center (QFC) began an investigation in March 2018 into the suspected manipulation of the Qatari riyal, Qatari government securities and related financial instruments. Qatar has also asked U.S. regulators to investigate the U.S. unit of FAB on similar grounds. In a statement on Sunday, the QFC regulator said the fine was a result of FAB's failure to 'provide copies of the relevant trading records and related documentation' needed for the investigation despite a Qatari court order to do so. FAB has denied the market manipulation and said in a statement on Sunday that it had made 'good faith efforts' to resolve the matter with the regulator and provide 'all relevant and responsive information that it was required to disclose pursuant to QFC law.' 'Any allegations that FAB's QFC branch failed to provide appropriate disclosures are false,' the statement said. FAB said in June it was closing its sole branch in Qatar after the regulator placed restrictions on the bank that would prohibit it from undertaking new business. 'FAB is in the process of effecting an orderly wind-down of the QFC branch's operations, following many months of baseless actions ... that have made it impossible for FAB's operations to continue in Qatar,' the FAB statement said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt started a trade and diplomatic boycott of Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies. Qatar keeps its currency, the riyal, pegged at a fixed rate to the U.S. dollar, but saw it trade several percent weaker than its usual rate in offshore markets just after the dispute began. The QFC regulator said that FAB could be subject to 'additional disciplinary action' if warranted by its investigation and that it has the right to appeal the decision to the QFC Regulatory Tribunal."
