In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) played a key role in issuing guidelines to limit the spread of the virus. Pharmaceutical companies including Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca rapidly developed vaccines using innovative technologies such as mRNA. By December 2020, Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Later, in 2021, several countries, including Germany, Canada, and Japan, launched nationwide vaccination campaigns. Despite this, new variants such as Delta and Omicron led to fresh waves of infections, putting significant strain on healthcare systems worldwide.",
