Around 252 million years ago, a mass extinction event known as the "Great Dying" wiped out about 90% of life on Earth. The event marked the end of the Permian geological period and was triggered by volcanic activity in the Siberian Traps, which released massive amounts of carbon and other gases into the atmosphere. This caused intense global warming, leading to the collapse of ecosystems and the acidification of oceans. However, a major puzzle for scientists was why the planet remained lethally hot for an additional 5 million years, long after the volcanic activity had ceased.

A new study published in Nature Communications proposes an answer to this mystery: the collapse of tropical forests. Researchers from the University of Leeds and the China University of Geosciences believe that the Great Dying is unique because it's the only mass extinction where almost all plant life died off. To test this theory, they used a vast archive of fossil data from China to reconstruct maps of plants and trees before, during, and after the extinction. The results showed that the widespread loss of vegetation significantly reduced the planet's ability to store carbon, causing high levels to linger in the atmosphere for millions of years.

Forests are crucial for climate regulation because they absorb and store carbon. They also play a vital role in silicate weathering, a natural process that removes carbon from the atmosphere. Tree roots help break up rock, which aids this process. According to the study, when the forests died, this natural carbon cycle was severely disrupted. Michael Benton, a professor of paleontology not involved in the study, explained that the absence of forests suppressed carbon burial, leading to a "threshold effect" where the loss of forests became irreversible on ecological time scales.

This research offers a powerful warning for the future. The study's authors highlight that if rapid global warming causes today’s rainforests to collapse, the planet could reach a tipping point where warming accelerates, even if human carbon emissions were to stop. This makes it incredibly difficult for life to recover. While there's a possibility that today’s rainforests may be more resilient to high temperatures, the study makes it clear that pushing tropical forests too far could have catastrophic consequences. As study author Benjamin Mills warns, "If you warm tropical forests too much, then we have a very good record of what happens. And it’s extremely bad."

Around 252 million years ago, the 'Great Dying' eliminated about 90% of Earth's species, driven by volcanic emissions from the Siberian Traps that caused extreme global warming and ocean acidification. A recent study suggests that the prolonged post-extinction heat, lasting five million years, resulted from the collapse of tropical forests, which disrupted carbon storage and natural silicate weathering. Fossil data from China indicate that the widespread loss of vegetation prevented carbon removal from the atmosphere, amplifying warming. The research warns that modern tropical forests face a similar risk under rapid climate change, potentially triggering irreversible warming even if human emissions cease.

A cyber hacker broke into a database containing the personal information of millions of customers, Qantas (QAN.AX), opens new tab said, in Australia's biggest breach in years and a setback for an airline rebuilding trust after a reputational crisis. The hacker targeted a call centre and gained access to a third-party customer service platform containing six million names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers, Qantas said in a statement on Wednesday. The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here. The airline did not specify the location of the call centre or customers whose information was compromised. It said it learnt of the breach after detecting unusual activity on the platform and acted immediately to contain it. 'We are continuing to investigate the proportion of the data that has been stolen, though we expect it will be significant,' Qantas said, reporting no impact on operations or safety. Last week, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said cybercrime group Scattered Spider was targeting airlines and that Hawaiian Airlines (HAII.UL) and Canada's WestJet had already reported breaches. Qantas did not name any group. 'What makes this trend particularly alarming is its scale and coordination, with fresh reports that Qantas is the latest victim' of a hack, said Mark Thomas, Australia director of security services for cA cyberattack has compromised the personal information of millions of Qantas customers, marking Australia's most significant data breach in years. The airline announced on Wednesday that a hacker targeted a third-party customer service platform used by a call center, gaining access to the names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and frequent flyer numbers of six million people. Qantas stated it detected unusual activity on the platform and took immediate action to contain the breach, though it expects a "significant" portion of the data has been stolen. The airline has not disclosed the call center's location or the affected customers' nationalities.

The breach is a major setback for Qantas, which has been trying to rebuild its reputation following a series of controversies. These include illegally sacking ground workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, selling tickets for canceled flights, and allegedly lobbying the government to block a rival airline's request for more flights. Since taking office in 2023, CEO Vanessa Hudson has been working to improve the airline's public standing. Regarding the breach, Hudson stated, "Our customers trust us with their personal information and we take that responsibility seriously."

The attack on Qantas follows recent warnings from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that cybercrime group Scattered Spider is targeting airlines, with Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet already reporting breaches. Cybersecurity experts speculate that Scattered Spider may be responsible for the Qantas hack, as the group is known for impersonating tech staff to gain employee passwords. Charles Carmakal, CTO of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, stressed that while it's too early to confirm a link, "global airline organizations should be on high alert of social engineering attacks." Qantas has notified the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Australian Information Commissioner, and the Australian Federal Police about the incident. The airline confirmed that customer passwords, PINs, and login details were not compromised.

The company behind the popular AI coding editor, Cursor, has launched a new web app that allows users to manage a network of coding agents from their browser. This move is part of Anysphere's strategy to expand beyond its core integrated development environment (IDE) and make its AI-powered tools more accessible.

In recent months, Anysphere has been busy introducing new features. In May, the company launched background agents, which are AI systems that can autonomously complete coding tasks. This was followed by a Slack integration in June, allowing users to assign tasks to these agents by simply tagging @Cursor.

The company behind the popular AI coding editor, Cursor, has launched a new web app that allows users to manage a network of coding agents directly from their browser. The launch marks the next step for Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, as it moves beyond its core integrated development environment (IDE). The company is making a concerted effort to expand its product offerings and provide more agent-powered experiences for users.

In May, Cursor introduced background agents—AI systems that can autonomously solve coding tasks without user supervision. This was followed by a Slack integration in June, which enables users to assign tasks to these background agents by tagging @Cursor. This functionality is similar to how Cognition's AI coding agent, Devin, operates.

The new web app now allows Cursor users to send natural language requests via a browser, on either desktop or mobile, to assign tasks such as writing features or fixing bugs in their codebase. The app also lets users monitor the progress of agents, view their work, and merge completed changes into the codebase. According to Andrew Milich, Cursor's head of product engineering, the Slack integration and web app are part of an effort to "remove the friction" for users.

Anysphere announced last month that Cursor has achieved over $500 million in annualized recurring revenue, largely driven by monthly subscriptions. The company also stated that more than half of the Fortune 500, including major companies like Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe, now use Cursor. To capitalize on this growth, Anysphere recently launched a new $200-per-month Pro tier for Cursor.

The path to superintelligence is unclear. But Meta is chasing it anyway. The tech giant has jumped headfirst into building a superintelligence lab, seeking to create an AI system that can far outperform human intelligence in all domains. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has attempted to court hundreds of talented engineers and researchers for the lab with eye-popping pay packages, according to The Wall Street Journal. With Meta facing powerful competition in the red hot AI industry, the company's commitment to superintelligence may be a bid to play catch-up and a "case of one-upmanship," said Bob Rogers, chief product and technology officer of Oii.ai and co-founder of BeeKeeper AI. "They probably have a fear that someone's going to end up with the ultimate model that wipes out everybody else, and they'll end up being beholden to one organization," he said. But without a precise vision, chasing superintelligence may be a pipe dream, he said. "Going after a vague, undefined goal is not usually the path to success," said Rogers. "To immediately jump from where we are now – which is (large language models) being really cool language factories – and skipping (artificial general intelligence) to go straight to superintelligence is bold."

Superintelligence, not 'Superwisdom' As it stands, superintelligence is only theoretical. There are a number of hurdles in the way of creating an all-knowing AI model: As it stands, researchers haven't figured out how to make AI stop hallucinating, especially as we continue to challenge models with reasoning. The harder the task, the more likely it is to make a mistake, said Rogers. For an AI model to be considered superintelligent, "It's got to be really good at not hallucinating," he said. In addition to the technical obstacles, creating a system that's that intelligent is incredibly risky, said Rogers, and could be riskier depending on who is in charge of it. The larger models get, the more unpredictable they become, he said. Plus, even if developers create kill switches, the models may be powerful enough to work around them.

Beyond the barriers and risks, the pot of gold at the end of the superintelligence rainbow may not be worth it, said Rogers. Enterprises are currently struggling to manage the large language models of today, and often find success with implementing small, niche models and agents, something which Meta's Llama family of models happen to be well-suited for, he noted.

Meta is ambitiously pursuing a superintelligence lab to develop AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains, offering lucrative packages to attract top talent. Experts caution, however, that the goal is highly theoretical and fraught with technical and ethical risks, including AI hallucinations, unpredictability, and control challenges. Meanwhile, practical applications of AI today favor smaller, specialized models, suggesting that Meta’s pursuit of superintelligence may be more about industry competition than immediate utility.

As the world's largest standalone cybersecurity company, Palo Alto Networks has potentially much to gain from a splintering world. Not to mention, its stock offers a relatively unfiltered view of investor confidence in the sector. But while the company has risen nearly 9% so far this year, and some analysts are gung ho, a look under the hood suggests that astronomical growth can't carry on forever, even if geopolitics feels like a dice roll in a game of Risk at the moment.

The Maturity Equation
Back in January, almost 60% of organizations including private companies told the World Economic Forum that geopolitical tensions have impacted their cybersecurity strategies. Many are also on edge about risks: One in three CEOs said they were worried about losing sensitive information or intellectual property to cyber-espionage, and 45% of cyber leaders expressed concern about operational and business disruptions. The rise of state-sanctioned cyberattacks, with China and Russia the best-known sponsors, and recent warnings to US companies to prep for potential cyberattacks from Iran have inflamed tensions. All that suggests a market for Palo Alto Networks to grow into, what with its next-generation firewalls, cloud security services and AI-powered security operations. Goldman Sachs analysts are among those who see this logic: They maintained a buy rating on the company earlier this month, citing its revenue growth of roughly 14% in the past 12 months and its success in selling new products to existing customers.

But, on the other hand, there's a maturity challenge: Palo Alto Networks sales growth has slowed — its revenue growth was in the mid-20s percentage points in 2023, and its latest quarter saw revenues grow 15.7% year over year. Meanwhile, the growth of annual recurring revenue — which offers a glimpse into the company's ability to retain customers — has declined in five straight quarters, and it's expected to be around 32% this year, compared with 45% or more in previous years. Even as Palo Alto beat revenue and earnings expectations in its latest quarter, the slowdown suggests the company may be maturing and reaching a plateau where customer adoption is slowing —a reality that cybersecurity firms will have to learn to live with, as other industries have. Nevertheless, the sector is expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade, meaning there will be plenty of dollars to compete for, but likely more competitors. Palo Alto, at the very least, proved more resilient during a week of concerns about conflict with Iran than the broader tech industry. Its shares rose 0.8% last week, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF fell 1.8% over the same period.

Hitting the Firewall
Nikesh Arora, the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, makes a living putting up firewalls, but he also knows the feeling of rejection. He told the Humans of Bombay podcast earlier this month that after graduating from university, he was rejected from more than 400 jobs. "I saved all the rejection letters," he said. "They're my motivation."

# Reference
Palo Alto Networks, a leading cybersecurity firm, is well-positioned to benefit from rising geopolitical tensions and the growing demand for advanced security solutions. While the company continues to grow and innovate with AI-driven services, its revenue and customer retention rates show signs of slowing, suggesting that it may be reaching market maturity. Despite these challenges, the cybersecurity sector’s long-term expansion offers ample opportunity, and Palo Alto’s resilience amid recent global uncertainties highlights its strong market standing.

Researchers compared raw AI models with their chat-trained versions to understand what safety training actually changes inside the model—like finding the 'off-limits' neurons that make a model refuse harmful requests. They discovered that Anthropic's standard comparison technique was hallucinating thousands of fake differences, but their BatchTopK fix revealed real interpretable safety circuits like refusal detection and stereotype filtering, capturing 88% of behavioral changes versus just 60% for the broken method.
